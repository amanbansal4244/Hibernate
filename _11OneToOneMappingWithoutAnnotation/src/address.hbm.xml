 <!-- Main concept of hibernate relations is to getting the relation between parent and child class objects
Cascade attribute is mandatory, when ever we apply relationship between objects, cascade attribute transfers operations done on one object 
onto its related child objects.
If we write cascade = “all” then changes at parent class object will be effected to child class object too, 
if we write cascade = “all” then all operations like insert, delete, update at parent object will be effected to child object also
Example: if we apply insert(or update or delete) operation on parent class object, then child class objects will also be stored into the database.
default value of cascade =”none” means no operations will be transfers to the child class -->
